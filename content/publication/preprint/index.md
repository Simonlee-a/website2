abstract: "In this work, we introduce Multiple Embedding Model for EHR (MEME), an approach that views Electronic Health Records (EHR) as multimodal data. This approach incorporates 'pseudo-notes', textual representations of tabular EHR concepts such as diagnoses and medications, and allows us to effectively employ Large Language Models (LLMs) for EHR representation. This framework also adopts a multimodal approach, embedding each EHR modality separately. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MEME by applying it to several tasks within the Emergency Department across multiple hospital systems. Our findings show that MEME surpasses the performance of both single modality embedding methods and traditional machine learning approaches. However, we also observe notable limitations in generalizability across hospital institutions for all tested models."
